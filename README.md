## Introduction
MyCar is a website for selling and buying cars. Anyone can view cars listed on the website. To sell a car the user has to create an account and add a listing. Options for buying a car are not available at the minute. But this would be a future feature where users can buy as well. Once an id is created for selling a car, the user will get a verification email to confirm their registration. A profile is also created upon registration which they can update if they wish to. A seller is given the flexibility to create a listing, and edit or delete it. There is also a search option where anyone can search for a car.
